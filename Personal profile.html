<p><b><u>A little bit about myself:</u><br>
<br>
I am 25 years old, I was born in Petah Tikva, Israel. <br>
I have an amazing parents, and four siblings (two brothers and two sisters) I am the youngest. <br>
Since I can remember, I loved computers and technology and was always drawn in to it.
After high school I started my military service that lasted 3 years, <br>after my release I started working at Migdal Insurance Company in a back-office position. <br>
As for now - I'm currently working at a delivery company and also a student of Quality Assurance & Automation.

<u>My Hobbies:</u><br>
<br>
My main hobby since I was 16 is motorcycles/scooters.<br>
I really like to ride my scooter and upgrade it with different accesories that I usually order online!<br>
Also I like to take pictures of my scooter from different angles and positions (I will add some of them here).<br>
